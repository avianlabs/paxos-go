    Profiles hold asset balances, and every Paxos transaction is on a particular profile.
    Depending on your integration type, Profiles may be used to reflect both corporate balances or individual user balances.
    There are two types of Profiles:
    - `DEFAULT` Profiles are system-generated.
    - `NORMAL` Profiles are created using the [Create Profile](#operation/CreateProfile) endpoint and are the only type of Profile you can create.

    Quotes are "held rates" offered by Paxos to buy or sell assets at a specific
    price within a period of time - for example, the option to buy BTC within
    the next 30 seconds for $8,000.

    The typical Quotes workflow is as follows:

    1. Call [List Quotes](#operation/ListQuotes) to get the latest available
       quoted prices for the assets you want to buy or sell.
    1. Present the offered price to one or more end-users, with a timer
       indicating the time to expiration.
    1. If a user accepts the price, call [Create Quote Execution](#operation/CreateQuoteExecution) with the amount to buy or sell.
    1. Call [Get Quote Execution](#operation/GetQuoteExecution) to monitor
       for completion and know when the funds from the execution are available.

    It's important to show end-users the latest available price. If you cache
    prices to show them to multiple users, you should refresh the cache once
    per second.

    You can call [List Quote Executions](#operation/ListQuoteExecutions) to
    review or construct reports on quote execution activity.
  name: Quotes
- description: |
    Quote Executions buy or sell assets using a Quote obtained from
    the [Quotes](#tag/Quotes) flow.
  name: Quote Executions
- description: |
    <p>There are three types of orders: market, limit and post-only.</p>
    <p>Market orders guarantee execution at a variable price and quantity. Limit orders guarantee price and quantity at the time of execution but do not guarantee execution. Post-only is an order type that will only be placed on the order book if it is the maker side of a trade.</p>
  name: Orders
- description: |
    Market data provides various parameters of the order book and historical order data.
  name: Market Data
- description: |
    Pricing provides historical data related to charting of asset prices.

    Note: Some Pricing API markets may be unavailable for trading.

    Issuer Quotes are "held rates" offered by Paxos to mint or redeem Paxos-issued assets at a specific price within a period of time - for example, the option to buy PAXG within the next 5 seconds for $3,000.

    The typical Issuer Quotes workflow is as follows:

    1. Call [Create Issuer Quote](#operation/CreateIssuerQuote) to get a quote for the asset you want to mint or redeem to a specific profile.
    1. Call [Create Issuer Quote Execution](#operation/CreateIssuerQuoteExecution) with the quote ID and profile ID.

    You can call [List Issuer Quote Executions](#operation/ListIssuerQuoteExecutions) to review or construct reports on issuer quote execution activity.

- description: "An Identity represents a person or institution who is able to take\
    \ actions on the Paxos Platform. Depending on \nyour integration type you might\
    \ not need to create Identities for your end users. \n\nIdentities must pass a\
    \ set of verifications and checks before they're able to transact on the Platform.\
    \ Learn more\nabout getting started with Identity and managing their onboarding\
    \ lifecycle in the [Identity Developer Guide](https://docs.paxos.com/identity).\n"
  name: Identity
- description: |
    Institution Members allow you to associate persons with an institution on our Platform.
    Each institution can have multiple members, with each member representing the relationship to a person identity.

    When creating an institution identity, you must designate at least one institution member.
    This requirement ensures we have complete information about the institution's ownership structure
    and key personnel, which is necessary to onboard institutions.
  name: Institution Members
- description: |
    Accounts connect Identities (persons or institutions) to Profiles (asset balances).
    Key features include:

    - **Balance Management**: Track and manage profile balances via [Subledgering](https://docs.paxos.com/crypto-brokerage/ledger-type#fiat-and-crypto-subledger)
    - **Joint Account Support**: Link multiple Identities to a single Account for shared on platform balance

    Accounts are required for all Identity API integrations.
  name: Accounts
- description: "Account Members allow you to associate an Identity with an Account\
    \ on our Platform.\nEach Account can be linked to multiple Identities, which supports\
    \ Joint Accounts (where two Identities have the ability\nto transact against a\
    \ single Profile)  \n\nAccount members are effectively immutable. In order to\
    \ update an account member,\nclients should remove then re-add the account member\
    \ with the desired state.\n\nThe API requires clients to have write access on\
    \ the account and all identities\nassociated with the account.\n"
  name: Account Members
- description: |
    The Identity Documents API allows clients to send documents to Paxos to validate identities
    during the KYC process. Files can be updated multiple times by re-sending the document type
    for processing.

    We currently accept the following file formats:
    - <code>pdf</code>
    - <code>jpg</code>
    - <code>png</code>

    Steps to upload a document are as follows:
    1. Send a <code>PUT</code> request to <code>/identity/identities/{id}/documents</code> to get
      the upload URL.
    1. Send your document to the provided URL via a PUT request. Take the following example using curl:
      <code>$ curl --upload-file Proof_of_residence.jpg $URI </code>

    Uploaded document metadata will be available via <code>GET</code> request to <code>/identity/identities/{id}/documents</code>

    Use the Settlements API to facilitate simultaneous exchange of pre-funded assets. Automate a variety of use cases that require two-party approval, including net settlement of over-the-counter trades, withdrawal requests for tri-party collateral, payment requests, and bilateral settlement for marketplace end users.

    The simple request-and-approval workflow supports both one-directional and bidirectional transactions to allow a user to receive an asset (for example, send USDP) or simultaneously send and receive assets (for example, send USD and receive BTC and ETH). Only when all parties are in agreement and assets are fully funded does the Settlements API allow for change of custody. Upon completion, all settled assets are immediately available for trading, transferring, withdrawal or other supported activities.

    The Source Profile initiates the transaction for the Target Profile to approve. The `DIRECTION` of each asset is always relative to the Source Profile and only the owner of the Source Profile can cancel a transaction if it hasn't been approved by the Target Profile.

    Move assets between two Entities belonging to the same Organization or to a different Organization on the Paxos platform.

    > Transferring USD between Entities is prohibited in some jurisdictions. Contact [Support](https://support.paxos.com/) if you run into any problems with this restriction.

    Ensure the destination [Profile](https://docs.paxos.com/dashboard/organization#profile) already exists before beginning the transfer. This may require contacting someone outside your Organization to get the destination Profile ID.

        could impact the identity's ability to transact on the Platform.
        - Setting `set_user_disabled` to `true` will make the Identity `DISABLED` (read [more here](https://docs.paxos.com/identity/statuses) on what this means)
        - Setting `tax_details` will update all the tax details for the identity
        - Setting `last_kyc_refresh_date` indicates this is not an adhoc-update, and instead an update for a [periodic kyc refresh](https://docs.paxos.com/identity/kyc-refresh)

        Changing an Institution Identity to a Person and vice-versa is not supported.

        Create an account for a given identity, via the `identity_id` field.
        This identity is the primary owner of the account for all tax-related purposes.

        To track user balances using Paxos [Profiles](#tag/Profiles), use `create_profile=true` when creating the account.
        Once an account has been created, it is not possible to associate it with a [Profile](#tag/Profiles).

        ### Account Members

        In addition to the primary owner, other identities may be associated with the account, by using `members`.
        The identity on the account is treated as a BENEFICIAL_OWNER.

        To add a financial advisor to an account, add a member with the FINANCIAL_ADVISOR role.

        #### Example
        This example request creates a joint account for John and Jane Doe. John has identity_id=82c338f4-3cb7-4d9b-be2a-4b077c82ee3a,
        and Jane has identity_id=0f5d8475-33f3-4ebd-88a0-66dedc2581c1. John is the primary owner of the account for tax-purposes, but Jane
        is a full beneficial owner.

        Additionally, this account has an associated financial advisor with identity_id=0d26f878-298e-4d47-81be-cdf4e982a3d3.

        ```json
        {
        "account": {
        "identity_id": "82c338f4-3cb7-4d9b-be2a-4b077c82ee3a",

        \ members and the new member. The below example adds an `AUTHORIZED_USER`\
        \ to the account.\n\nIn order to add account members while leaving existing\
        \ account members unaffected, clients \nshould use the [Add Account Members](#operation/AddAccountMembers)\

        \ at least one element. In order to delete all members \nfrom an account,\
        \ clients should use the [Delete Account Member](#operation/DeleteAccountMember)\
        \ API.\n\n```json\n{\n\"account\": {\n\"id\": \"82c338f4-3cb7-4d9b-be2a-4b077c82ee3a\"\

        \ members' roles\nTo update an account members' roles, the `members` field\
        \ must contain all the existing members with their roles along \nwith the\
        \ additional role that you'd like to add or remove. The below example adds\

  /markets/{market}/historical-prices:
    get:
      description: |-
        Retrieves a set of average prices at a certain increment of time for the requested market.
        This endpoint is suitable for retrieving historical average price trends where price precision, execution, and
        other detailed information is not required.
        To control the count, use either  `increment` or `max_data_points`.
        List Historical Prices returns an error when an unexpected value is given, or when `increment` and
         `max_data_points` are both given or omitted.

        When `range.begin` is omitted, the first data point shows the mid price, the average of the order book best bid
         and ask price, or the earliest available date. It is possible to set `range.begin` to a future date without error.

        When `range.end` is omitted, the last data point will display current mid price (average of order book best bid
         and best ask) at the request timestamp. It is possible to set `range.end` to a future date without error.

        When `pagination.limit` is omitted, the pagination limit will default to return the first 100 items.
        If the pagination limit is set, the API will return up to the limit in one response. The pagination limit max is 1,000.

        Time-series items are returned in chronological (ascending) order. All timestamps are in UTC.

        For limit orders, create an order for buying or selling an asset:

        - To buy, set `side = BUY` and set `base_amount` to the crypto amount you want to buy.
        - To sell, set `side = SELL` and set `base_amount` to the crypto amount you want to sell.

        For market orders, create an order for buying or selling an asset:

        - To buy, set `side = BUY` and set `quote_amount` to the dollar amount you want to spend.
        - To sell, set `side = SELL` and set `base_amount` to the crypto amount you want to sell.

        There are five types of orders:

        - Limit Orders: Buy or sell at a specified price or better. Execution not guaranteed. Taker orders will be rejected if price deviates 15% from midpoint.
        - Post-Only Limit Orders: have the same properties as Limit Orders, but get rejected if they cross the orderbook.
        - Market Orders: Operate as Immediate or Cancel (IOC) orders. Price is variable, executes at best available price at time of order.
        - Stop Market Orders: Will convert to a market sell order with the specified quantity when the stop price is hit. The stop price does not guarantee that it will be executed at that price. Market conditions (price) might change between the order being triggered and order being executed. Currently only sell stop loss orders are supported.
        - Stop Limit Orders: have a Stop Price which when hit, will convert to a limit sell order that will be executed at a specified price (or better)

        Maximum notional order size by type:

        Order Type | Market  | Maximum Notional Value (USD)
        ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------
        Market     | all     | 500,000

        with ID `quote_id`.

        The amount to buy or sell must be specified in either fiat or crypto by setting
        exactly one of:
         - `base_amount` to specify the amount of crypto to buy or sell.
         - `quote_amount` to specify the amount of fiat to spend or acquire.

        An otherwise-valid request to create a quote execution may fail with the following
        types of errors:
         - [Expired](https://developer.paxos.com/docs/v2/problems/expired) if the quote
           with ID `quote_id` has expired.
         - [Insufficient Funds](https://developer.paxos.com/docs/v2/problems/insufficient-funds)
           if the profile with ID `profile_id` has insufficient available balance to
           fund the execution.
         - [Rejected](https://developer.paxos.com/docs/v2/problems/rejected) if extreme
           market conditions (e.g. a very large price swing) have invalidated the quote.
         - [Already Exists](https://developer.paxos.com/docs/v2/problems/already-exists)
           if a Quote Execution with the same `ref_id` has already been created.

        Withdraw a cryptocurrency asset to a specified destination address.

        **Important for Stellar Network (PYUSD):**

        When withdrawing PYUSD on the Stellar network, the destination address must have an established trustline with the PYUSD issuer:

        - **PYUSD Issuer**: `GDQE7IXJ4HUHV6RQHIUPRJSEZE4DRS5WY577O2FY6YQ5LVWZ7JZTU2V5` (mainnet)
        - **Asset Code**: `PYUSD`

        **How to Establish a Trustline:**

        The recipient must use a Stellar wallet or the Stellar SDK to:
        1. Ensure their account has minimum XLM balance (at least 1 XLM recommended)
        2. Create a trustline to the PYUSD issuer for the PYUSD asset
        3. Confirm the trustline is active before requesting withdrawal

        **Verifying Trustline Status:**

        You can verify if an address has the required trustline by:
        - Using Stellar blockchain explorers (e.g., stellar.expert)
        - Querying the Stellar Horizon API
        - Using the Stellar SDK to check account balances

        List all transfers, optionally filtering and paging the results.

        By default, transfers are returned in reverse chronological (descending)
        order by creation time.

        The recommended polling workflow is to query the results in ascending
        order (by setting `order_by` to `CREATED_AT`), keeping track of the
        `created_at` timestamp of the most recent transfer in the paged results.
        Once transfers are discovered, the caller should store the returned `ID`
        and query GetTransfer to retrieve status updates.

          For example:

          `updated_at.gte = 2022-07-01T03:02:01Z`, `order_by = UPDATED_AT`

          Using `updated_at.gte = 2022-07-01T03:02:01Z`, `order_by = CREATED_AT` is an invalid pairing.

        Creates a new bilateral Settlement Transaction with one or more legs. The customer must own the
        `source_profile_id` specified in the transaction.

        A successful response indicates the transaction has been accepted and will be in an initial `status` of `"PENDING"`
        for settlement, the transaction is only eligible for settlement once the `status` is `"AFFIRMED"` by the
        `target_profile_id` and the current time is between the provided `settlement_window_start` and `settlement_window_end`.

        Settlement will only be enacted once both `source_profile_id` and `target_profile_id` have sufficient balances to
        fulfill all legs specified as settlement is **atomic**.

        This endpoint enables you to fetch a list of events that have been created by the system.
        You can use query parameters to filter the results by the `created_at` time using `created_at.lt`, `created_at.gt`, etc. and you can
        `limit` the number of events returned.

        Using `created_at` and `limit` together will allow you to paginate through all events owned by you.
        Events returned will always be order in `created_at` ascending order.

        Message that represents an arbitrary HTTP body. It should only be used for
        payload formats that can't be represented as JSON, such as raw binary or
        an HTML page.


        This message can be used both in streaming and non-streaming API methods in
        the request as well as the response.

        It can be used as a top-level request field, which is convenient if one
        wants to extract parameters from either the URL or HTTP template into the
        request fields and also want access to the raw HTTP body.

        Example:

            message GetResourceRequest {
              // A unique request id.
              string request_id = 1;

              // The raw HTTP body is bound to this field.
              google.api.HttpBody http_body = 2;

            }

            service ResourceService {
              rpc GetResource(GetResourceRequest)
                returns (google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateResource(google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (google.protobuf.Empty);

            }

        Example with streaming methods:

            service CaldavService {
              rpc GetCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);
              rpc UpdateCalendar(stream google.api.HttpBody)
                returns (stream google.api.HttpBody);

            }

        Use of this type only changes how the request and response bodies are
        handled, all other features will continue to work unchanged.

      description: |-
        `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a
        URL that describes the type of the serialized message.

        Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form
        of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.

        Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any;
            any.PackFrom(foo);
            ...
            if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
              ...
            }

        Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

            Foo foo = ...;
            Any any = Any.pack(foo);
            ...
            if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
            }
            // or ...
            if (any.isSameTypeAs(Foo.getDefaultInstance())) {
              foo = any.unpack(Foo.getDefaultInstance());
            }

         Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

            foo = Foo(...)
            any = Any()
            any.Pack(foo)
            ...
            if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
              any.Unpack(foo)
              ...

         Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

             foo := &pb.Foo{...}
             any, err := anypb.New(foo)
             if err != nil {
               ...
             }
             ...
             foo := &pb.Foo{}
             if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil {
               ...
             }

        The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use
        'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack
        methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'
        in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type
        name "y.z".

        JSON
        ====
        The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular
        representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an
        additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

            package google.profile;
            message Person {
              string first_name = 1;
              string last_name = 2;
            }

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
              "firstName": <string>,
              "lastName": <string>
            }

        If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON
        representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field
        `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`
        field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

            {
              "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
              "value": "1.212s"
            }
      example:
        '@type': '@type'
      properties:
        '@type':
          description: |-
            A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
            protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
            one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
            the fully qualified name of the type (as in
            `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
            (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

            In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
            expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
            scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
            server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:

            * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
            * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
              value in binary format, or produce an error.
            * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
              URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
              lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
              on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
              breaking changes.)

            Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
            protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
            type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely used type server
            implementations and no plans to implement one.

            Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
            used with implementation specific semantics.
